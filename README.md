# Y86
This is a CPU based on a simplified version of x86 architecture. It is written in Verilog and designed in Xilinx Vivado 2018.3.1
Only the source verilog, and instantiation files for memory blocks are in this repository. I plan to update the repository with a pipelined version and programs to run on it.
